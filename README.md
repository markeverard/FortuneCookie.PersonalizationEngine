# FortuneCookie.PersonalizationEngine

The Fortune Cookie Personalization Engine for EPiServer extends the Visitor Groups functionality in EPiServer CMS 6 R2

## Requirements
The Personalization runs on EPiServer CMS 6 R2 (which can be downloaded from EPiServer World). The NuGet package (see below) is available compiled against ASP.NET 3.5 or ASP.NET 4.0

## Installation
The easiest way to install the PersonalizationEngine is to install the Nuget package directly from the EPiServer Nuget Feed http://nuget.episerver.com

Alternatively follow these steps,
- Add a reference to FortuneCookie.PersonalizationEngine.dll
- Copy the Views folder (and its content) into your web project into the following location ~/modules/PersonalizationEngine
- Add the following key to the EPiServer.Shell configuration section in your web.config file

<episerver.shell>
    <publicModules rootPath="~/modules/" autoDiscovery="Minimal">
        <add name="PersonalizationEngine">
	    <assemblies>
	        <add assembly="FortuneCookie.PersonalizationEngine" />
            </assemblies>
	</add>
    </publicModules>
</episerver.shell>

Did I mention that Nuget will do all of this for you at the click of a button?

## Future Enhancements
- We've got a lot of ideas about future enhancements to the Personalization Engine. Some ideas that may either be rolled into this project or a separate related project
- More ContentProviders
- Provider specific to the EPiServer Commerce API
- Recently viewed pages ContentProvider - to show you pages youâ€™ve recently visited
- GeoTaggedContentProvider - some kind of tag matching based around personalization that looks for content that is tagged as close to you
- More UI examples - such as Custom Properties (@croweman is already working on this), a dynamic content plugin, possible some form of Composer module
- Would love to hear your ideas............
